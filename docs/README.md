# Welcome!

To the new **All The Guides**, by **All The Mods**

This guide is currently a work in progress, so there's a-lot of missing / placeholder information. Want to contribute? Check [About All The Guides](guides/contributing/README.md)

??? Tip "Guide is only for our packs"

    Our modpack has custom changes and additions, specifically recipes. This means that this guide may or may not work or accurately with other packs!

## Intro

Are you new to **Minecraft**, **Modded** (**All The Mods**), or just need some help getting started? Here you will find some tips & guides on getting started with our **All The Mods** packs!

### Getting Started

**All The Mods** packs requires a PC that has at-least **16GB** or more system RAM :material-information-outline:{ title="Random Access Memory" } for the best **playable** experience.

Allocating between **8-12GB** RAM is required for most of our packs. Smaller - designed packs can run with at-least **4GB** allocated. This **must** be changed within your [Launcher](#launchers) settings, as by default **4GB** is assigned, but **8GB** minimum is **required**.

### Requirements

- [x] An official **Mojang** / **Microsoft** account for **Java Edition**.
- [x] A third party [launcher](#launchers) that can download, install, and run our packs.
- [x] A PC with at-least **16GB** or more **RAM**. :material-information-outline:{ title="Random Allocated Memory" }

### Launchers

The most common launchers are [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/download/app), [FTB App](https://www.feed-the-beast.com/ftb-app), [PolyMC](https://polymc.org/), [Prism](https://prismlauncher.org/), [ATLauncher](https://atlauncher.com/) and [GDLauncher](https://gdlauncher.com/en/). You will need one of these launchers to install packs. After installed, sign to your **Microsoft** account, then search for the pack of choice to install. 

!!! Note

    By default, in the launcher or instance (modpack) settings, **4GB** is allocated. **Recommended** MAX allocation is **8-12GB** | `8192-12288`Mb. You should **never** allocate all of OR more ram than necessary.

    Additionally, some launchers may install and use the appropriate version of [Java](help/java.md), though make sure you're using the correct version of [Java](help/java.md) for the **Minecraft** version of the pack installed.
