# All The Mods 0

All The Mods 0 is a 1.7.10 kitchen sink pack built around ChromatiCraft and RotaryCraft.

All the Mods started out as a private pack for just a few friends of mine that turned into something others wanted to play! It has all the basics that most other "big name" packs include but with a nice mix of some of newer or lesser-known mods as well. 

In All the Mods 0 we will continue the tradition adding many new mods while going for more stability.

Does "All The Mods" really contain ALL THE MODS? No, of course not.
