# Apothic Enchanting

???+ danger "OUTDATED"
	Due to an update at some point to Apothic Enchanting, all setups in this guide will not yield the intended values. Even the in-game questline has some incorrect setups. This guide will be updated with new setups later.

## Max Enchanting Setup

??? information "Max Enchanting Shelves List"
	- [ ] 5x Soul-Touched Sculkshelf
	- [ ] 5x Soul-Touched Deepshelf
	- [ ] 3x Heart-Forged Seashelf
	- [ ] 1x Draconic Endshelf
	- [ ] 1x Geode-Encased Bookcase of Stability

Craft 16x **Seashelf** and place all but one in the usual enchanting configuration.

Now take your last Seashelf and **infuse it**. You should see an infusion option for 3 EXP. Now replace one of the uninfused **Seashelf** with your **Infused Seashelf**. Repeat this until all 16 `Seashelf` are `Infused Seashelf`. You will have one extra `Infused Seashelf`.

After all of shelves are infused, you'll need to break 12x Infused Seashelf and craft 3x **Heart-Forged Seashelf** and 9x **Crystalline Seashelf**. After you're done crafting them, place them down.

Now craft 10x **Dormant Deepshelf** and infuse them into their **Deepshelf** varient.

!!! info "You must be level 60+ to infuse Dormant Deepshelves"

After infusing all 10 dormant deepshelves, use them to craft 5x **Soul-Touched Deepshelf** and 5x **Echoing Deepshelf**. Then upgrade them to their **Sculkshelf** variant. *Remember to use EMI to see the recipes.* 

Now you need to craft 1x **Geode-Encased Bookcase of Stability**. 

You can infuse a **Block of Amethyst** to get **Budding Amethyst**. Place 3x **Heart-Forged Seashelf** and 2x **Soul-Touched Deepshelf** to infuse it.

### Treasure Enchants
