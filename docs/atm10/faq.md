	??? Question "Why does my game crash while launching?"
		Lack of RAM most likely. Send `?allocate` in the **#bot-spam** channel in our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/allthemods) to learn how to allocate more RAM. If that's not the problem, head to **#atm10-techsupport** and send `?logs` to see how to upload your crash/latest log.

	??? Question "I crashed and got `Error code 1`, please help"
		`Exit code 1` is a generic error from Minecraft. It is no different than "game didn't load, no longer attempting to load. Please refer to the output error log created by your launcher" if you are unsure... please feel free to ask for further instructions on how to locate, post, and get help for your specific error so that we may further assist you in our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/allthemods). Try running `?logs` instead.
