# Apotheosis

This guide will show how to build different infusion setups. I will __not__ include crafting recipies since you can find them in JEI. Everything else can be found in the **Apotheosis** in-game guide `Chronicle of Shadows`.

## Max Enchanting Setup

The enchanting progression is the **exact** same for ATM8 and ATM9. [Here's a link to that guide.](https://alltheguides.pages.dev/atm9/apotheosis/ "ATM9 Apotheosis Max Enchanting Guide")

## Infusion Setups

You do not have to place the blocks exactly as I do, the screenshots are just an example.
