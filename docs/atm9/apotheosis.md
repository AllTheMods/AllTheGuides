# Apotheosis

### Spawner Changes

- **Remove AI**: {~~Chorus Fruit ~> Golden Apple ~~}
- **Ignore Players**: {~~Nether Star ~> Conduit ~~}
- **Increase Entities**: Ghast Tears | Max {~~ 32 ~> 16 ~~}
- **Increase Spawn Count**: {~~Fermented Spider's Eye ~> Piglich Heart~~} | Max {~~ 16 ~> 8 ~~}
- **Decrease Minimum Spawn Delay**: {~~ Sugar ~> AllTheModium Ingot ~~} | Min {~~ 20 ~> 100 ~~}
- **Decrease Maximum Spawn Delay**: {~~ Clock ~> Unobtainium Ingot ~~} | Min {~~ 20 ~> 100 ~~}

The aim of these changes are to make removing AI easier, give Conduits more of a use, encourage people to look out for good spawners in the world, and bring spawners more in line with the other options available for farming mob drops like Hostile Neural Networks or Mystical Agriculture or Productive Bees WannaBee mob farms.
