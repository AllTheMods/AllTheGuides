**All The Mods 9** Frequently Asked Questions

---

??? Question "Why can't I use modular router and watering can?"
    By default, **Mystical Agriculture** does not allow fake players to automate watering cans. If you dislike this change, it can be changed within `config/mysticalagriculture-common.toml` > `fakePlayerWatering = true`.

??? Question "Why is flight disabled?"
    Flight is disabled in certain dimensions (**The Other**, **Blue Skies**, and **Twilight Forest**), to add more difficulty towards progression. If you dislike this change, it can be disabled in `worldName/serverconfig/noflyzone.snbt`

??? Question "Why isn't '`insert name`' mod in ATM9 yet?"
    ATM packs does not literally contain "All The Mods". Our main focus is having mods that's not: 1) buggy, 2) ruins performance or progression. If a mod supports Minecraft version **1.20.1**, and **Forge** (Not NeoForge), you may make a [suggestion](https://github.com/AllTheMods/ATM-9/issues/1).
	
??? Question "Do I need to chunkload all the chunks my Chunk Destroyer is going to mine?"
    You do *not* need to load chunks you're mining. You only need to chunkload the chunk the **Chunk Destroyer** is in.
	
??? Question "How do I remove enchants from a book/weapon?"
    - You can drop an anvil onto **Obsidian** with the enchanted book/weapon along with **Books** for each separate enchantment (EX: You have a book with 3 different enchants, you'd need 3 books to split those enchants). 
	- You can also enchant the anvil with **Splitting** (Only splits books/weapons with 1 enchant) or **Obliteration** (Splits any number of enchants)

??? Question "What's the little 3D cube next to my crosshair?"
	It's from Quark, the default keybind to toggle it is ++k++.
