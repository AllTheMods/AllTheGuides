# Mahou Tsukai

**Mahou Tsukai** is a magic mod focused mainly on spell uniqueness and special effects, instead of focusing on how spells are created, as many magic mods do. Many of the spells are based on similar concepts in Fate/Stay Night and other media, but knowledge of these media are not at all necessary to understand and enjoy the mod. 

## ATM9 Mahou Changes

- Increasing **Innate Cap** requires throwing **Ender Upgrade Orbs** (83 max) in Mahou lake along with **Caliburn**
- Converting **Caliburn** to **Morgan** requires killing **Warden** with **Caliburn**
