# Mekanism


### Power Gen Changes

#### Buffed

- **Bio Generator**: {~~ 280 ~> 500 ~~} RF/t | Makes it more of an option instead of straight out using **GBG**.

#### Nerfed

- **GBG Ethylene**: {~~ 78K ~> ~8.5k ~~} RF/t | *super nerfed* but promotes good setups.
    - Higher burn rate = more melons needed for setup.
- Recipe has been made harder for the **GBG**.
