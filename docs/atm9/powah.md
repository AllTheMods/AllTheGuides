# Powah!

**Powah** is a tech mod that adds Various ways to generate, store, and transmit Forge Energy.

### Power Gen Changes

- **Soul Lava** can now be used in the **Magmator**. This doesn't increase RF/t, but generates 9x more RF per mb.
- Early game generators have been given a buff to make it feel better to start in **Powah** vs other mods. The changes are as followed:

#### Furnator

- **Starter**: 80 RF/t (_up from 20_)
- **Basic**: 160 RF/t (_up from 80_)
- **Hardened**: 400 RF/t (_up from 200_)
- **Blazing**: 1000 RF/t (_up from 800_)

#### Magmator

- **Starter**: 80 RF/t (_up from 20_)
- **Basic**: 160 RF/t (_up from 80_)
- **Hardened**: 400 RF/t (_up from 200_)
- **Blazing**: 1000 RF/t (_up from 800_)

#### Thermo Generator

- **Starter**: 40 RF/t (_up from 20_)
- **Basic**: 80 RF/t (_up from 60_)
- **Hardened**: 150 RF/t (_up from 125_)
- **Blazing**: 300 RF/t (_up from 250_)
- **Niotic**: 600 RF/t (_up from 500_)
- **Spirited**: 1500 RF/t (_up from 1250_)
- **Nitro**: 3500 RF/t (_up from 2750_)

??? Note

    While these are small buffs, using **Soul Lava** gets a massive buff here. **Nitro** tier goes from ~25k RF/t to ~31.5k RF/t.*
    
#### Solar Generators

- **Starter**: 40 RF/t (_up from 20_)
- **Basic**: 120 RF/t (_up from 60_)
- **Hardened**: 400 RF/t (_up from 180_)
- **Blazing**: 1,500 RF/t (_up from 540_)
- **Niotic**: 5,000 RF/t (_up from 1,620_)
- **Spirited**: 16,000 RF/t (_up from 5,000_)
- **Nitro**: 50,000 RF/t (_up from 20,000_)

??? Note

      While it may seem like a massive buff, **Solar Panels** are more expensive than almost every other generator, including **Reactors**. Each tier requires 3 of the previous tier, so this should make them more of an enticing option for late game players.
