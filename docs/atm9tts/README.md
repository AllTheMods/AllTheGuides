# All The Mods 9

[![](img/atm9TTSLogo.png){.center}](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/all-the-mods-9-to-the-sky)

**All The Mods** started out as a private pack for just a few friends that turned into something others wanted to play! It has all the basics that most other "big name" packs include but with a nice mix of some of newer or lesser-known mods as well. 

**All The Mods 9 To the Sky** is the cap off to the trilogy of sky packs for allthemods. We have taken feedback from the first two iterations to make this pack the best we have to offer, adding in mods that were not in the others, such as **Forcecraft** and **Forgiving Void** to lower the sense of danger in the hopes to make this the most open-ended ATM pack yet! 

This skyblock pack features **Ex Machinis**, which is an automation addon for **Ex Nihilo** built in house by ATM to take you from early game all the way to end game automated resources.

Does "**All the Mods**" really contain **ALL THE MODS**? No, of course not.
