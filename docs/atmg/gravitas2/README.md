# All The Mods - Gravitas²

Per aspera ad astra - Through hardships to the stars.

Starting from primitive stone age technology, hand-knapping your tools, foraging for food, you will progress through the ages covering many classic and new mods to complement the TerraFirmaCraft experience.Create New Age, Thorium Reactors, Integrated Dynamics, Applied Energistics, Stargate Journey Ice & Fire and perhaps the most anticipated addition, GregTech. You will voyage from a primitive beginning, smashing rocks together, to smashing atoms together, to power your voyages to the stars and beyond!

**All The Mods** started out as a private pack for just a few friends that turned into something others wanted to play! It has all the basics that most other "big name" packs include but with a nice mix of some of newer or lesser-known mods as well. 

Does "**All the Mods**" really contain **ALL THE MODS**? No, of course not.
