# All The Mods 3

All the Mods started out as a private pack for just a few friends of mine that turned into something others wanted to play! 

It has all the basics that most other "big name" packs include but with a nice mix of some of newer or lesser-known mods as well.

For example; Thaumcraft, Ender IO, Thermal Expansion for the big names and Rustic, Traverse and FastWorkBench for the not as well known!

Can you get to the Creative items by making the "**ATM Star**"? 

In **All the Mods 3** we will continue the tradition adding many new mods while going for more stability.

**Does "All The Mods" really contain ALL THE MODS? No, of course not:** *[Modlist](https://rawgit.com/AllTheMods/ATM-3/master/modlist.html)*
