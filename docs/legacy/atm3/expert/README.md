# All The Mods 3 - Expert

In the third iteration of the all the mods expert series, we hope to breathe life back into expert under a new perspective, you wont be spending your days infront of a crafting table over and over, and the goal isnt to get ae2 autocrafting to prevent this, we feel that you should be embracing what the mods have to offer and automate the machinery inside of those instead, this pack pushes for renewable resources but if thats not what you like to do, thats totally fine as quarries and coal based fuel sources are still a viable option.

**All the Mods** started out as a private pack for just a few friends of mine that turned into something others wanted to play! 

It has all the basics that most other "big name" packs include but with a nice mix of some of newer or lesser-known mods as well.

**Does "All The Mods" really contain ALL THE MODS? No, of course not.**
