# All The Mods 3 - Remix

**This is a new take on ATM3 for 1.12!** While we were working on the "6.0" update for ATM3, it became so large and expansive that it would break existing worlds and have a number of drastic changes for people familiar with the pack so far. To make the transition easier on the players we have decided to split that planned update into it's own modpack that we're calling **ATM3: Remix.** 

We are eager to start developing a modpack based on 1.13 minecraft but until that's ready, **ATM3:Remix** is chance to have a fresh take on a 'kitchen-sink' pack with the well-established 1.12 modded offerings.

**ATM3:Remix** will take over as the more actively-developed and update pack. We **will** continue to update the normal/legacy/classic ATM3 pack with bugfixes and content, just on a slower more "end-of-life" basis at least until the majority of the community has had a chance to finish playing their worlds without feeling abandoned. 

**All the Mods** started out as a private pack for just a few friends that turned into something others wanted to play! It has all the basics that most other "big name" packs include but with a nice mix of some of newer or lesser-known mods as well. Thaumcraft, Ender IO, Thermal Expansion for the big names and Bird's Foods, Traverse and FastWorkBench for the not as well known! 

In **All the Mods 3: Remix** we will continue the tradition of making the most stable and reliable pack we can that still adds as many new and unique mods alongside usual fan-favorites. 

**Does "All The Mods" really mean ALL THE MODS? No, of course not:** *[Modlist](https://rawgit.com/AllTheMods/ATM3-Remix/master/modlist.html)*
