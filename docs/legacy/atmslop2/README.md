# All The Mods - Slice Of Pie 2

This pack is designed to be run on lower spec machines and still get the experiences that the larger packs offer.

We even made it light enough that even a Raspberry Pi can be used as a server!

Raspberry Pi requirements

- Raspberry Pi 4 4GB.
- Works with Raspbian but Ubuntu 64 bit is recommended.
- USB 3 stick/ssd/hdd to run the server from.

**All the Mods** started out as a private pack for just a few friends of mine that turned into something others wanted to play! 

It has all the basics that most other "big name" packs include but with a nice mix of some of newer or lesser-known mods as well.

**Does "All The Mods" really contain ALL THE MODS? No, of course not, especially not this slice of the pi**
