# Applied Energistics 2

---

![](img/logo.png)

Welcome to Applied Energistics 2 and my attempt at a guide that's simple enough for anyone to understand.

!!! tip "If you're wondering how to automate something or need a step-by-step, you can look into the [Setups](setups) section"

## Capabilities of AE2

AE2 probably one of the most **well-known** mods out there, and the best (completely unbias) mod out there.

### Logistic
With AE2 you can move so many **different things** around and in probably the **best** performing way any mod does. Using your **Me System** you can move any item anywhere at any point at near instant speeds.  

### Storage
The **Matter Energy System** can be used to store many different things, ranging from items and fluids to mana and energy. You can store **billions** of items without much effort, search for them and use all those items to craft even more.

### Autocrafting
Using all the stored items from your system, you can **autocraft** both using AE2's Molecular Assemblers or machines from **other mods**. You can make ginormous crafts, using millions of items and dozens of machines and AE2 will take all this effort from you with a single click.

## Limitations of AE2

I know many people out there prefer **Refined Storage** because of its simpler approach to a lot of things, so I want to use this opportunity to address some of the seemingly **nonsensical limitations** right away.

### Channels
Probably the biggest complaint right at the beginning: **Channels**. Channels arent as much of a problem as so many people make it seem.

You can easily get thousands of Channels, and when using P2P, moving all those Channels isn't much of an issue as well.

For more info on channels, check [Channels](channels.md)

### Type Limit
The so despaired **Type Limit** the **ME Storage Cells** have, once again exists for a very simple reason: Protecting you from yourself.

**NBT Items** or items with unique data on them, cannot be stacked unlike regular items and therefore take up quite a bit of memory. If you have too much memory in a single chunk, your game will **crash**, and you will be locked out of your world.

AE2 directly discourages you from having too many **NBT Items** inside your **ME System** by making them fill your storage incredibly quickly. Other Mods like **Refined Storage** do ***not*** have this limitation and therefore will very quickly run into issues. 

There are also some **Applied Energistics Addons** that promise to either remove or increase the type limit. **ABSOLUTELY DO NOT TRUST THEM!** Some of the mods that remove the Type limit have some ways to prolong the effects of NBT Overflow, but especially the ones that just increase the limit often have **absolutely no protection!**

For more info on Types, check [Storage](storage.md)
