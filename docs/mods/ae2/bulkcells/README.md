# Preface

This is a guide to the best storage cell (totally unbiased) you'll ever need :]  

In this chapter, You'll find **How to Use Bulk Cells**, the **characteristic of the Bulk Cells** itself, the **general idea of "Bulk Storage"** and so much more.  

!!! warning "Disclaimer"
    Going through this without prior experience of **Applied Energistics 2** mod might be difficult to grasp. I still encourage you to read the [AE2 Online Guide](https://guide.appliedenergistics.org/) first (or quick-read the guides here).

Currently, this chapter splits into 4 different subchapters.  



!!! danger "You can skip to [How To Use](bulkhow.md) subchapter if you dislike reading & just wanted to know how to do all of this"
