# Bulk Cells

## Preface

This is a guide to the best storage cell (totally unbiased) ever :]  

In this section, you'll find out **how to use Bulk Cells**, the **characteristics of Bulk Cells**, the **general idea of "Bulk Storage"**, and so much more.  

!!! warning "Disclaimer"
    It may be difficult to grasp the concept of Bulk Cells without prior experience of **Applied Energistics 2**. I encourage you to read Satherov's [AE2 Guide](../README.md) or the [official AE2 Guide](https://guide.appliedenergistics.org/) first.

Currently, this chapter splits into 4 different subchapters.  

!!! danger "You can skip to [How To Use](bulkhow.md) subchapter if you dislike reading & just wanted to know how to do all of this"
