# Setups

Here you will find some extra setups for AE2 that you wont find on the online Guide.

!!! info "AE2 Guide"
    It's still recommended that you check out the [AE2 Online Guide](https://guide.appliedenergistics.org/1.21/example-setups/example-setups-index) if you need something that you can't find here.

## Currently present Setups

As of writing this guide, you can find the following setups here:

### Inscribers
- A small setup which is easily expandable and can be set up within a few minutes.
- **Snow's Setup** using SFM which is just as easily expandable, but a lot more versatile and only uses a single channel.

### Controller
- The **16k Controller** used by Sath.

### Certus Crystal Farm
- An easy **Certus Crystal** Setup using **Growth Accelerators**.
