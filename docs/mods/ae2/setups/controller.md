# Sath's ME Core

This will be a Step-by-Step of the Controller I use in my builds, giving you a grand total of **16,384 Channels** over **16 Dense Cables** with **32 P2P Tunnels each**

---

## Requirements

???+ list "Items required"
    - [ ] 208x ME Controller
    - [ ] 512x P2P Tunnel
    - [ ] 32x Wireless Connectors
    - [ ] a lot of ME Cables
    - [ ] Color Applicator (recommended)
    - [ ] Personal Shrinking Device (recommended)

## Base

For the Base, you'll need approximately **13x13x13** Blocks of Space.

![](img/controller/controllerBase.png)

Go up **3 Blocks** and build the following structure

![](img/controller/controller1.png)

Then extended it upwards, connecting the smaller cubes like this

![](img/controller/controller2.png)

Build it up all the way

![](img/controller/controller3.png)

Then add the same connections on top

![](img/controller/controller4.png)

And now mirror the entire thing

![](img/controller/controller5.png)

## P2P Tunnels

For starting the P2P Tunnel placement, pick a side and copy this

![](img/controller/p2p1.png)

Then add cables in any color

![](img/controller/p2p2.png)

Then add Dense Cables and a **Wireless Connector**

![](img/controller/p2p3.png)

!!! warning "Make sure to **color** the **Wireless Connector** in the same color as the cables using the **Color Applicator** (it won't update if it's unpowered, but you can see the color with Jade)"

Then build this around

![](img/controller/p2p4.png)

For the next side, you need to rotate the middle contracture by 90 degrees

![](img/controller/p2p5.png)

And now just add the same thing on top as before

![](img/controller/p2p6.png)

Repeat this for all 6 sides

![](img/controller/p2p7.png)

## Inner P2P

For the four Connectors on the **inside** of the controller, it's easiest if you're **tiny**. Use the **Personal Shrinking Device** for that and then build the following inside **1 Corner**

![](img/controller/corner1.png)

!!! info "The structure is cut open here to make it easier to view."

Add cables like this

![](img/controller/corner2.png)

And finally the **Wireless Connector**

![](img/controller/corner3.png)

Repeat this in the **diagonally opposite corners**. In the end, it should look like this

![](img/controller/done.png)

## Wireless Connectors

Once you're done with all that, you can build the following structure and mirror it in each corner. I'm using **Creative Energy Cells** here, but you can use anything to power the **Wireless Connectors**

![](img/controller/connectors1.png)

Finally, link the **Wireless Connectors** and add a **Subnet Controllers**

![](img/controller/connectors2.png)

## Using the Controller

To actually get **Channels** from the controller, you can pull a **Dense Cable** from the small controllers at the bottom.
Then pull of a **small Cable** from that and add a **P2P Tunnel**. 
Connect it to one from that line as the dense Cable originates and you're done
